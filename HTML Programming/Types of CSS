There are several ways to integrate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) into a web page. Here are some common methods:

1. Inline CSS: This method involves placing CSS rules directly into the HTML elements using the "style" attribute. 
   For example:
   <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is some text.</p>

2. Internal CSS: This method involves placing CSS rules in the head section of the HTML document using the "style" tag. 
   For example:
   <head>
   <style>
   p {
       color: red;
       font-size: 20px;
     }
   </style>
   </head>
   <body>
   <p>This is some text.</p>
   </body>
   
3. External CSS: This method involves creating a separate CSS file with all the CSS rules and linking it to the HTML document using the "link" tag. 
   For example:
   <head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
   <p>This is some text.</p>
   </body>
