OOP - Object Oriented Programming
POP - Procedural Oriented Programming

OOP and POP are two different ways of writing computer code.
OOP organizes code into objects that contain data and methods, 
while POP organizes code into procedures that are executed in a sequence. 
OOP emphasizes hiding implementation details and supporting flexibility,
while POP is more focused on the execution of procedures. 
OOP is typically used in larger and more complex programs, 
while POP is more commonly used in smaller and simpler programs.
